# Platform Starter Kit Example

Cal.com Platform Starter Kit showcases the new Cal.com Platform API and Cal.com Atoms. It was built using the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Deploy your own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcalcom%2Fexamples%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fstarter&env=TURSO_DATABASE_URL,TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN,NEXT_PUBLIC_REFRESH_URL,AUTH_SECRET,AUTH_TRUST_HOST,NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_API_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_REFRESH_URL,CAL_SECRET&envDescription=You%20can%20see%20how%20to%20populate%20the%20environment%20variables%20in%20our%20starter%20example%20â†’&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcalcom%2Fexamples%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fstarter%2F.env.example&project-name=cal-platform-starter&repository-name=cal-platform-starter&demo-title=Cal.com%20Experts&demo-description=A%20marketplace%20to%20book%20appointments%20with%20experts&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fexperts.cal.com&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcalcom%2Fexamples%2Fassets%2F8019099%2F2e58f8da-a110-4a45-b9a4-dcffb45f9baa)

## How to use

**1. Clone the repository**

HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calcom/examples.git
```

GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone calcom/examples
```

**2. Move into the Starter**

```bash
cd examples/starter
```

**3. Install dependencies**

<!-- note(richard): We require pnpm since we have this version deployed; if we separate example source from our deployed version, we free up the package manager choice. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Package Manager:** This repository is deployed as-is and therefore contains a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file. As a result, you currently have to use `pnpm` as your package manager to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

**4. Set Environment Variables**

We provide most environment variables out of the box (including Cal-related variables).

So get started by copying the `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

_4.1 Database_

This project uses SQLite with Turso. You can create one for free at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech/).

Then, get the URL and Access Token from the Turso dashboard and update the respective values in your `.env` file:

```.env
# Prisma (Turso Database from https://turso.tech/app)
# https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/turso
TURSO_DATABASE_URL="libsql://<your-database-name>.turso.io"
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN="eyJhbGc****"
```

To initialize the database models in your turso database, you have to apply the schema like so:

> [!TIP]
> Replace `turso-prisma-db` with the name of the database you created on turso. ðŸ‘‡

```bash
turso db shell turso-prisma-db < .starter/prisma/migrations/20240414212357_init/migration.sql
```

> [!NOTE]
> For your database schema changes, please note that the usual Prisma workflows differ. From [Prisma's docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/turso#how-to-manage-schema-changes):
>
> > Prisma Migrate and Introspection workflows are currently not supported when working with Turso. This is because Turso uses HTTP to connect to your database, which Prisma Migrate doesn't support.
> > To update your database schema:
> >
> > 1. Generate a migration file using prisma migrate dev against a local SQLite database:
> >    `npx prisma migrate dev --name init`
> > 2. Apply the migration using Turso's CLI:
> >    `turso db shell turso-prisma-db < ./prisma/migrations/20230922132717_init/migration.sql`
> >
> > Replace `20230922132717_init` with the name of your migration.
> >
> > For subsequent migrations, repeat the above steps to apply changes to your database. This workflow does not support track the history of applied migrations to your remote database.

_4.2 Authentication_

Generate a NextAuth secret and add it to your `.env` file:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

```.env
# Next Auth
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with
# openssl rand -base64 32
# <https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret>

AUTH_SECRET="SQhGk****"
```

_4.3 Cal_

For **development**, you're all set! We've provided you with our sandbox keys that you can find the `.env.example` file.

For **production**, keep in mind that you'll have to update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_REFRESH_URL` variable to make it point to your deployment, e.g.:

```.env
# 3/ *REFRESH URL.* You have to expose an endpoint that will be used from calcom: https://cal.com/docs/platform/quick-start#4.-backend:-setting-up-refresh-token-endpoint

NEXT_PUBLIC_REFRESH_URL="https://<your-project>.vercel.app/api/cal/refresh"
```

**5. Development Server**
From here, you're all set. Just start the development server & get going.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with Cal.com Platform and the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.
